## Overview

This assignment explores spatial analysis of malaria prevalence in The Gambia using R and geostatistical methods. Key tasks include:

* Loading and preprocessing the malaria dataset from the geoR R package, aggregating by location, and converting it into a spatial sf object.

* Mapping observed malaria prevalence and visualizing total cases across locations.

* Simulating data from the prior predictive distribution using Matérn covariance and creating histograms of simulated prevalence for selected locations.

* Fitting three spatial models with INLA:

Exponential covariance model

Matérn model using SPDE2

Matérn model with penalized complexity priors

Constructing meshes, prediction stacks, and generating maps of predicted prevalence, 95% credible intervals, and exceedance probabilities.

Organizing estimated parameters into tables and visualizing model outputs on maps for comparison.

This homework demonstrates the application of geospatial statistics, spatial modeling, and Bayesian inference in R, providing both numeric summaries and interactive HTML visualizations of the results.
